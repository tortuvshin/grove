# Why Grove

Grove exists for teams who want **the source of truth to be a human-readable file in their repo** and want a static, deploy-anywhere output for it.

If your content already lives in files that your contributors are comfortable editing (YAML, Markdown, taxonomy files, JSON), Grove turns that content into a website plus a set of derived surfaces — without changing the way you write.

If your content lives in a database, a CMS, or a vendor service today, Grove is probably not the right tool yet. A database-driven system will keep performing better for problems that are themselves database-shaped.

## What Grove is

- A **static-site-first framework** with built-in sync, classification, and review tools.
- A way to keep a single source of truth in files and let the rest follow.
- A publisher for both human-facing pages and machine-readable surfaces: `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, JSON-LD, OG cards, JSON datasets.
- A way to keep external facts (stars, forks, archive status, contributors) current without manual effort.

## What Grove is not

- A **database**. There is no runtime; the build is fully static.
- A **CMS**. Editors don't log in. Files are the editor.
- A **directory starter**. A directory is one use case — not the boundary.
- A **community platform**. Grove gives no chat, no auth, no reactions. Use the file system.
- A **content-first renderer** you can fork and theme forever. Grove's presentations are stable and known; if you want unbounded design freedom, an empty Astro starter is a better choice.

## When Grove is the right call

Grove pays off when **the same knowledge needs to be authoritative everywhere at once**:

- You maintain a directory of OSS tools, agents, or libraries that dozens of contributors read.
- You publish a community resource hub that needs both a website and machine-readable feeds (RSS, JSON, `llms.txt`) for AI assistants.
- You want curatorial judgment (visibility, sort priority, "why this is listed") expressed in files, not in a moderation backend.
- You want a maintenance loop — refresh facts on a schedule, surface stale records, keep the dataset clean — without writing a cron job.

Grove is **not** the right call if your content needs:

- Real-time editing in a browser.
- Approvals, scheduled publishing, or multi-stage workflows.
- Per-user personalization or paywall logic.

## withgrove.dev

`withgrove.dev` is one real Grove-powered space that demonstrates the framework. It is **evidence** that Grove works; it is **not** the definition of Grove. Other shapes — research collections, technology ecosystems, editorial knowledge bases, internal knowledge hubs — are first-class too.

## Try it in ten minutes

The [Quickstart](/start-here/quickstart/) installs the CLI, scaffolds a space, and shows the dev server in under ten minutes. The [Getting Started](/getting-started/scaffold/) walk goes deeper.
