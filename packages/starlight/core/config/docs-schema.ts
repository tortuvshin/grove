 *
 * Detecting that from the parsed frontmatter is unreliable: Starlight builds some entries in code
 * rather than through the schema — its fallback 404 route hardcodes `hero` — so those look stripped
 * even on a correctly configured site. Instead, `@grove-dev/starlight/schema` records that it was
 * imported, which answers the actual question: did the user wire the extension up at all?
